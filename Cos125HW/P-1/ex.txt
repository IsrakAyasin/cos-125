A series of escapades demonstrating the adage that what is good for the goose is also good for the gander , some of which occasionally amuses but none of which amounts to much of a story .	
 This quiet , introspective and entertaining independent is worth seeking .	
 Even fans of Ismail Merchant 's work , I suspect , would have a hard time sitting through this one .	
 A positively thrilling combination of ethnography and all the intrigue , betrayal , deceit and murder of a Shakespearean tragedy or a juicy soap opera .	
 Aggressive self-glorification and a manipulative whitewash .	
 A comedy-drama of nearly epic proportions rooted in a sincere performance by the title character undergoing midlife crisis .	
 Narratively , Trouble Every Day is a plodding mess .	
 The Importance of Being Earnest , so thick with wit it plays like a reading from Bartlett 's Familiar Quotations	
 But it does n't leave you with much .	
 You could hate it for the same reason .	
 There 's little to recommend Snow Dogs , unless one considers cliched dialogue and perverse escapism a source of high hilarity .

I still like Moonlight Mile , better judgment be damned .	
 A welcome relief from baseball movies that try too hard to be mythic , this one is a sweet and modest and ultimately winning story .	
 a bilingual charmer , just like the woman who inspired it	
 Like a less dizzily gorgeous companion to Mr. Wong 's In the Mood for Love -- very much a Hong Kong movie despite its mainland setting .	
 As inept as big-screen remakes of The Avengers and The Wild Wild West .	
 It 's everything you 'd expect -- but nothing more .
